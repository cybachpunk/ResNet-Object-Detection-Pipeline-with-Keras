# ResNet-Object-Detection-Pipeline-with-Keras
This project contains an end-to-end object detection pipeline built with TensorFlow 2.x. Region of Interest (ROI), extracting rich metadata, and storage are focus areas. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, making it an excellent foundation for production-level computer vision systems.
